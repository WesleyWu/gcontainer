# Golang container data types implemented with generics support

Most implementations and tests is copied from [goframe](https://github.com/gogf/gf).

Since goframe has too many third-party dependencies and only supports go version 1.15,
I decided to separate the implementation of containers from the goframe project into this gcontainer project, 
and successfully achieved zero dependencies.
